A game made in a week for a birthday.

Notice: all the assets belong to their respective owners, which should be properly credited ingame. If they are not (or you are not comfortable with this) please reach out to me.

P.S.: I really dislike the way I made this. I am not accepting contributions to code nor should you use this as a baseplate for **anything**. It's not good.
